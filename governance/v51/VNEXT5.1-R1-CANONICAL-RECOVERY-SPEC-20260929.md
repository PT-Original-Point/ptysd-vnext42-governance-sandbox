# VNEXT5.1-R1 Canonical Recovery / Cross-Session Alignment Spec

Status: NONCANONICAL REVIEW CANDIDATE  
Project: CHATGPT_GLOBAL_SKILL_GOVERNANCE / 全自動軟體工廠  
Date: 2026-09-29  
Human current construction spec: VNEXT5.1  
Supersedes as CURRENT construction intent: VNEXT5.0-R3 and earlier R4-era continuation state  
Production authorization: NOT GRANTED

## 0. Problem statement

The Human has established VNEXT5.1 as the current construction specification, but the durable canonical control plane still resolves to:

- Mission: 20260926T220900+0800
- Execution Policy: 20260926T220900+0800-EP72
- Phase: VNEXT5_0_R3_MCP_CONTINUITY_FIRST
- Checkpoint: 192
- Active unit: R3-P0-03-FACTORY-ORPHAN-RECONCILIATION
- execution_fence: null

A VNEXT5.1 autonomy-unlock candidate already exists on noncanonical source, but it is not the canonical Mission/Policy/spec identity. Therefore a fresh Session that correctly follows Project Directory -> canonical control -> checkpoint -> Mission/Policy can truthfully return old V5.0-R3 state even though the Human has moved the project to V5.1.

This is a control-plane publication failure, not a memory problem.

Primary defect class:

SPEC_CONTROL_PLANE_REBASE_REQUIRED
CANONICAL_SPEC_LAG=true
HUMAN_DIRECTIVE_TO_CANONICAL_PUBLICATION_GAP=true

## 1. R1 objective

VNEXT5.1-R1 is not another narrative plan to be handed wholesale to an external agent.

Its purpose is to make the current Human specification, Mission, Policy, active run identity, and live Factory MCP behavior converge so every fresh Session/AI obtains the same current state from the canonical backend without relying on Memory, chat history, recent files, or handoff summaries.

## 2. Required authority model

Cold start for this Project MUST resolve in this order:

Project Directory exact project identity
-> active_run_ref / canonical control pointer
-> current checkpoint
-> current Mission revision
-> current Execution Policy revision
-> immutable current construction-spec ref/digest
-> active run/task/attempt identity
-> provider/live runtime readback when required

The current construction-spec identity MUST be provider-addressable and immutable. A fresh Session MUST NOT infer the current spec from the newest filename, recent chat, Memory, Library recency, or a noncanonical PR title.

The Human's latest explicit Mission-level instruction remains superior to an older persisted Mission. If persisted state lags, the system MUST surface SPEC_CONTROL_PLANE_REBASE_REQUIRED and prioritize publication/rebase instead of silently treating the old persisted phase as current intent.

## 3. Single synchronized execution state

There MUST be one current operational identity for the Project.

Checkpoint, run record, active task, attempt ID/epoch, and current policy MUST agree on the same active unit.

The existing condition where checkpoint 192 identifies P0-03 while runs/V50-R3-001/run.json retains older P0-01/P0-02 state is not acceptable as a steady state.

Acceptance:

- one canonical active task identity;
- one current attempt identity;
- one current policy revision;
- no stale run record may override a newer canonical checkpoint;
- no human-readable worklog becomes a second authority;
- worklogs/reports are projections from canonical/provider evidence only.

## 4. Factory MCP guard decomposition

Do not treat every SYSTEM-capable operation as the same authorization problem.

### 4.1 Fixed read-only diagnostics

Read-only operational observation MUST be available without a Host-mutation fence through constrained, fixed-purpose probes.

Preferred implementation: extend the existing read-only factory_status surface rather than creating a fifth public MCP tool.

Required bounded read-only probe classes include at minimum:

- capability_status;
- orphan_records with per-record identity sufficient for same-source classification;
- FactoryMCP installed-runtime prestate metadata/hashes needed for repair planning;
- service/process/scheduled-task identity relevant to Factory MCP;
- current broker/receipt state;
- current trusted-caller identity metadata.

These probes MUST NOT accept arbitrary PowerShell and MUST NOT mutate Host state.

### 4.2 Arbitrary host_powershell

host_powershell remains a four-tool-surface capability and may execute arbitrary PowerShell as SYSTEM.

Mission/checkpoint/run/task rollover, per-Session reauthorization, stale historical wake payloads, and local governance generation values MUST NOT independently disable transport after the Human has persistently authorized reversible pre-Production construction.

Retain real safety controls:

- exact Project/Host target;
- STOP;
- stale active attempt when a real backend fence exists;
- unresolved ambiguous external effect;
- provider/backend CAS/revision conflict;
- Production/Human-reserved gate;
- bounded timeout/output;
- durable receipt;
- same-source readback;
- operation-owned rollback;
- no blind replay.

## 5. Trusted caller boundary is a real security gate

Do not solve autonomy by turning arbitrary local NETWORK SERVICE processes into SYSTEM PowerShell callers.

A shared principal such as NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE is insufficient by itself when multiple local processes can share that SID.

Before unrestricted live host_powershell promotion, establish an OS-enforced caller boundary that uniquely identifies the intended Factory MCP caller. Acceptable designs include a dedicated service account/service SID or an equivalently unique ACL-protected IPC/request boundary.

This security condition is distinct from the self-imposed Mission/checkpoint/run/task transport locks that R1 removes.

## 6. Cross-project read-only decoupling

Business projects MUST NOT depend on arbitrary SYSTEM execution for provider read-only operations when the provider offers a bounded native read API.

For HANYAO Ads/LINE observability, Cloudflare D1 read-only reconciliation is architecturally separable from Factory MCP and SHOULD use a least-privilege provider read lane when credentials can be bound safely.

Factory MCP remains appropriate for the privileged Windows/gcloud/SYSTEM execution path that genuinely requires the Host.

This prevents a Factory MCP host-transport incident from making independent read-only observability blind.

## 7. R1 construction order

R1-00 CANONICAL SPEC IDENTITY
- Publish this exact V5.1-R1 spec as an immutable provider-addressable artifact.
- Bind the current Mission/control plane to the exact ref/digest.
- Fresh cold start must report CURRENT_SPEC=VNEXT5.1-R1.

R1-01 MISSION/POLICY REBASE
- Publish a new Human-authorized Mission revision superseding V5.0-R3 persisted intent.
- Publish a matching Execution Policy revision.
- Preserve Production=false, paid fallback=false, business auto-admission=false.
- Encode persistent authorization for ordinary reversible pre-Production work.
- Remove Mission/checkpoint/run/task/per-Session rollover as transport authorization gates.

R1-02 RUN/CHECKPOINT COHERENCE
- Reconcile canonical checkpoint and run record to one active task/attempt identity.
- Retire stale P0-01/P0-02 wait projection as current execution truth.
- Same-source readback must prove identity coherence.

R1-03 READ-ONLY BOOTSTRAP SURFACE
- Add bounded factory_status probes needed to inspect orphan identities and live install prestate without arbitrary Host mutation.
- Prove zero Host mutation.

R1-04 TRUSTED CALLER
- Replace shared-SID-only caller trust with a unique OS-enforced caller boundary.
- Negative test: another local process with a shared generic service principal cannot inject SYSTEM requests.

R1-05 TRANSPORT GUARD SIMPLIFICATION
- Remove duplicated Mission/checkpoint/run/task/generation transport gates.
- Retain real mechanical/safety gates from sections 4 and 5.
- Regression must prove a new Session/Mission/checkpoint rollover does not recreate SYSTEM_CAPABILITY_RUN_DENY for otherwise authorized pre-Production execution.

R1-06 LIVE FACTORY MCP INSTALL
- Exact source blobs, immutable hashes, exact target prestate, operation-owned backup, bounded install, restart, same-source readback.
- This is the principal local Windows last-mile unit and is the only part expected to require Codex/native local execution if Chat cannot directly execute it.

R1-07 CROSS-SESSION / COLD-START REGRESSION
With Memory/chat-history assumptions removed, a fresh controller must resolve:
- Project = CHATGPT_GLOBAL_SKILL_GOVERNANCE
- Current spec = VNEXT5.1-R1
- matching Mission/Policy
- matching checkpoint/run/task/attempt
- no stale R4/V5.0 state resurrected as current
- no Human reauthorization loop for ordinary reversible pre-Production work.

R1-08 LIVE MCP ACCEPTANCE
Required live probes:
- factory_status succeeds;
- fixed read-only probes succeed;
- host_powershell authorized-scope canary returns NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM;
- SYSTEM_CAPABILITY_RUN_DENY absent for authorized scope;
- SYSTEM_CAPABILITY_TASK_DENY absent for authorized scope;
- Mission/checkpoint rollover alone does not disable transport;
- exactly four public Factory MCP tools remain;
- Production remains denied.

R1-09 CROSS-PROJECT RECOVERY
After Factory MCP R1 live acceptance:
- run HANYAO Production D1/Google Ads fresh read-only reconciliation;
- distinguish real no-lead state from attribution/outbox/provider/reporting loss;
- only then proceed to separate Production deployment/business gates.

## 8. Codex boundary

CHAT_CAN_DO => CHAT_MUST_DO.

GitHub/control-plane/spec/PR/readback work stays with ChatGPT when connectors can execute and validate it.

Codex is not the owner of VNEXT5.1-R1. Codex is eligible only for the minimal local last mile that Chat cannot perform directly, primarily exact Windows runtime prestate/install/restart/canary work, and only under a current explicit Human opt-in for that exact scope.

No old-session Codex permission is inherited.

## 9. R1 completion criteria

VNEXT5.1-R1 is complete only when all are true:

1. CURRENT_SPEC resolves canonically to VNEXT5.1-R1 from a fresh Session.
2. Mission/Policy/spec/run/checkpoint identities agree.
3. No stale V5.0/R4 state can become current solely because it is persisted in an older run/handoff.
4. Fixed read-only Factory MCP diagnostics do not require a Host-mutation fence.
5. Trusted caller boundary is unique and OS-enforced.
6. Authorized reversible pre-Production host_powershell no longer fails due to self-referential Mission/checkpoint/run/task/generation gates.
7. Production/Human-reserved gates remain enforced.
8. Live Factory MCP canary passes with same-source readback.
9. HANYAO can perform the required fresh read-only reconciliation without being blocked by obsolete Factory control state.
10. A new Session repeats the same result without Memory or manual Human relay.

## 10. Explicit non-goals

- no Production approval;
- no paid fallback;
- no fifth Factory MCP public tool;
- no second canonical store;
- no new general orchestration layer;
- no blind removal of trusted-caller or unknown-effect protections;
- no claim that candidate/local tests equal live acceptance.
